[In the last article](/blog/BuildingBlocksOfMelody), we discussed the basic structure of a melody and how a melody is broken up into four motives.

We also learned that you can construct a melody from combining four motives together. So now the question becomes, how do we write a motive?

<!--end-of-intro-->

It's actually a lot easier than you might think. Essentially, anything can be a motive.

This means that no matter what you write could work as a motive for a strong melody.

"But wait?" you may be thinking. "If anything can be a motive, then why am I having so much trouble writing a melody? Isn't there such thing as a bad motive or melody?"

And well, yes. You can have a bad motive or melody. However, it's not about getting quality at the very beginning but rather starting with an idea and then molding it into something great. Composition is a process.

## Getting Started

The first step to writing a good motive is to simply write the first thing that comes to your mind. Don't hesitate. Write it down.

It may not sound like it says anything or has meaning, but that's okay.

For instance, here's a motive I first wrote about a year ago:

![Sample Motive 1](/blog/resources/greenFieldsMotive1.png "Sample Motive 1"){:.center-image}

I wrote it during a brainstorming exercise. I literally had about 25 seconds to come up with the motive. That's what I mean by not hesitation.

Here's another motive:

{% include quiz.html quizid="motiveBrainstorming" answer="3" question="What's the number one rule of brainstorming motives?" options="Your idea must have meaning | Go for perfectionism | Just write them down" explanation="Just write down your first ideas. You can always make them better. In fact, the further along we get in the process of writing these melodies, the more your motives and melodies will mean something." %}

> Okay, I did cherry pick these motives because they ended up working for me. But I can assure you, I wrote many, many bad motives before coming up with either of these two. That's okay. It's part of the process.

## Putting Them Together

The essense of building a melody up from here is to simply put the building blocks together. If you brainstormed 10, 20, 30, or even 100 motives, you have more than enough material to work off. Then it's simply a matter of litterally putting them together.

Now there is more than randomly combining motives. Because afterall, we want clear, coherent, and memorable melodies.
