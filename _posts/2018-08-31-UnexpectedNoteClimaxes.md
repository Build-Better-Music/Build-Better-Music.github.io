There are a multitude of techniques to creating [climaxes in melody](/blog/4WaysToAddMeaningToYourMelody). And the more techniques you have in your toolkit, the more variety you'll get and the more nuanced your melodies.

So today I'm going to give you a powerful tool that is easy to use and will add harmonic and pitch variety to your melody.

And that is the unexpected note climax.

<!--end-of-intro-->

## What Qualifies as Unexpected?

{% include youtube.html url="lu-gKijKA9Y" %}

The beginning of end credits from *Braveheart* has the same melody repeated 4 times.

Pay attention to where the climax is.

{% include quiz.html quizid="climaxlocation" answer="4" question="Where is the climax of the first instance of the melody?" options="0:13 | 0:17 | 0:25 | 0:29 | 0:33" explanation="At 0:29, there is a harmony that is not expected based on the context. Hence, that is the climax." %}

Here, the harmony is what's unexpected. And it happens two ways. Firstly, it is a major triad where the previous chords were diatonic clusters. This eases some of the tension that the clusters gave before it. Secondly, it is the b7 chord in D Major.

In other words, there is:

- Different chord structure
- Chord out of the key

So when you are using an unexpected harmony, you can either use a new chord type (triad vs. cluster) or a chord out of the key (C in D Major).

Essentially, to make something unexpected, you need to *set up a harmonic system* and then *break the system*.

Just like music in general, it's about *setting up expectations and breaking them*.

## Unexpected Notes vs. Harmony

The pattern is the same for an unexpected note. You still want to create some expectations about what the notes are, then you want to break from them.

Let's look at this through an example.

![Original Melody](/blog/resources/unexpectedNoteOriginal.png "Original Melody"){:.center-image}

This is our melody before a climax. Notice how there is already some chromaticism. Specifically, there are [leading tones](/blog/IncreasePitchVarietyInYourMelody#3-use-leading-tones-to-increase-tension) to 2&#770;, 3&#770;, 5&#770;, and 6&#770;.

To create our unexpected note, we want to break away from what comes before. That gives us two criteria for this example:

1. Something chromatic
2. Not a leading tone

Some possible ideas are using a flat (since all chromatics so far were sharped), or using a sharp that doesn't act as a leading tone.

Next, we want to scope out a potential spot for the unexpected note. The end of m6 looks like a good spot because that is the spot with the most tension already.

> Pro Tip: If you put your climax between motives 3 and 4, it will make them flow together, give more tension because there isn't a break, *and* will help make your climax seem like the inevitable result of your melody.

Let's see what this looks like.

Of course, there are several other possibilities. Here's two more.

## How do I Make the Unexpected Note Sound Unforced?

Instead of asking how it can sound unforced, let's take a moment and brainstorm some ways in which it can sound forced.

- Wildly different interval before / after the note
- No increase of tension before the note
- Not going by step into or out of the note

{% include quiz.html quizid="unforced" answer="1" question="Hmm. That last one is new. But why do you think that is there?" options="The note isn't connected to anything | The note will have some awkward leaps | The note will not fit into the context" explanation="It's because if the unexpected note isn't either approached or left by step, it will not sound connected to the rest of the melody. Steps connect notes together. So if the note has a leap on either side, it will sound disjointed." %}

As you are writing your melodies, pay attention to these ideas. Because by paying attention to them, you can make your melodies sound more seamless.
