So now [you have your motives written](/blog/WritingMotives).

But how do you organize them?

Sure, you could just do trial and error to find out the best structure for your motives. But what if I told you that there is a form that is guaranteed to work?

What if I told you I could take all the guesswork out of writing a melody out of motives?

Well, that's not a what if. I'm actually going to give that secret to you right now.

<!--end-of-intro-->

## How do I distinguish between motives?

We are going to use a naming system. Motives are going to be named with lowercase letters (e.g. *a*, *b*, *c*, etc.).

That way, when we talk about motive *a*, we know exactly which motive we are referring to.

Furthermore, the letter names tell us the order that the motives are presented in. The first motive is *a*, the second is *b*, and so forth.

And the last thing you need to know is how variations work. A variation on *a* becomes *a&prime;*. The prime symbol shows that it is a variation. A second variation would be *a&Prime;*.

## What counts as a variation?

There are only two requirements for a variation:

- They sound **similar** (like the second was derived from the first)
- They **are different** (they are not the same)

{% include quiz.html quizid="variations" answer="3" question="Which of the following is <em>not</em> a way to create a variation?" options="Change the rhythm | Transpose it | Rewrite it from scratch | Alter some pitches | Alter the articulations | Alter Dynamics" explanation="The second motive must share a resemblance to the first. I like to think of it as a 'first-time' rule. If you can't hear the resemblance the first time you listen to it, it's not a variation. Outside of that, you can vary any element you wish." %}

## Example

![Cradle Song Structure](/blog/resources/cradleSongStructure.png "Cradle Song Structure"){:.center-image}

Here are some things to note:

- The first motive is *a*
- The second motive is not based on *a*, so it gets the label *b*
- The third motive is a variation on a (in rhythm and transposition), so it gets *a&prime;*
- The fourth is not based on *a* or *b*, so it becomes *c*

Thus, the structure for Brahm's *Cradle Song* is *a b a&prime; c*.

## Try it Yourself!

{% include youtube.html url="fJ9rUzIMcZQ" start="60" %}

{% include quiz.html quizid="bohemianQuiz" answer="4" question="What is the structure of this melody from <em>Bohemian Rhapsody</em>?" options="<em>a a b&prime; c</em> | <em>a b a&prime; b&prime;</em> | <em>a b b&prime; c</em> | <em>a b a&prime; c</em>" explanation="The third motive is a variant of the first, and the last one does not match any of the others. If you got stuck, remember that the melody goes all the way to 1:28." %}

And that's the basis for naming the different motives. To get more practice, make sure to get your free worksheet below. If you are already a subscriber, that worksheet is in your inbox.

Now that you know how to name each motive, next time I'll give you the secret to organizing these motives.
