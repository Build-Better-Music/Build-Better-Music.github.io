We’re going to start simple: eight measure melodies. Yes, eight measure melodies. Why? Because once you learn how to write an eight measure melody, you know how to vary the length and keep it coherent and interesting. We’re keeping it simple.

So, without further ado, here’s the general structure for an eight measure melody:

First of all, notice that the entire eight measure structure is called a period. If you know what Chaplin's period structure is (the one taught in most schools that specifies different cadences), ignore that. You'll see that later and all that detail isn't the most helpful as a composer. Here, though, we are going to look at a broader and easier to use version of the period.

Next, notice how the period is broken up: into two phrases. The phrases are in turn broken up into two motives, which are broken up into measures. Isn’t this structure nice? If you start with eight measures, just keep breaking everything in half and you eventually get the building blocks of a melody.

What this also means (as we’ll see later) is that we don’t have to think of a melody as a gigantic eight measure chunk of music. We can instead start small (with motives) and combine elements until we create an eight measure melody.

But to get a better idea of what’s going on, let’s look at the main melody from Brahms’ *Cradle Song*:

The entire melody is eight measures so it’s a period. Next, each line consists of a four measure phrase. Additionally, each phrase is broken up into two motives which are two measures each.

And just to make sure you understand, take a look at the melody from the fourth movement of Grieg’s Peer Gynt Suite:

Go ahead, sing or play both these melodies and hear how they are broken up. Be sure to really absorb how these melodies are broken up as we are going to come back to both several times.

Once you’ve done that, the next thing to notice is that as you are singing the melody, you know where you are within the melody. You know if you are at the beginning of the melody, the middle, or approaching the end. Having motives and phrases as structural elements makes the melody easier to follow because they are the building blocks.

These building blocks guide listeners through the melody.

Of course, you can through them off, and we’ll get to that eventually. But now, realize that by creating a strong and coherent structure, we are guiding the listener.
