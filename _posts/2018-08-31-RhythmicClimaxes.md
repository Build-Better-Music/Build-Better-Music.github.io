When creating a [climax for a melody](/blog/4WaysToAddMeaningToYourMelody), it can become very tempting to talk about pitch.

However, the rhythm is equally important. And if you plan it right, the rhythm can completely carry the climax. Because rhythm is so instinctual and subtle, often times its effectiveness comes from the fact that listeners won't know that rhythm was the cause.

So for this post, we are going to dissect two of the key ways to create a convincing rhythmic climax.

## How Rhythm Creates Tension

Remember, a climax is the product of tension. So the first step to creating a convincing rhythmic climax is to understand how rhythm creates tension. Luckily, there are two easy ways.

1. Faster rhythm
2. Non-regular rhythm

Let's look at both in detail while referencing a "melody" that is purely rhythm: a percussion break.

Take a listen to the drum break above. On first listen, notice where the tension is built and then released. On your second listen, pay attention to where the faster notes are. Are they in the same spot?

Probably.

Furthermore, notice how each phrase gradually gets more and more rhythmic. This helps each phrase built on the last. That's one of the reasons why 0:43 is so effective. Each phrase before is a little bit more intense. Yet that moment has a long string of fast rhythms, which makes it even more intense than the rest. Same thing with the build to the end.

So when the final phrase comes, the intensity built up through the increasing rhythmic activity pays off. That's why the end feels climactic.

But there's another, more subtle way in which each of these is intense.

Right before the release of tension, there is some non-regular rhythm. I don't necessarily mean something like a 9-tuplet. But rather something that doesn't line up with what was before.

{% include quiz.html quizid="nonregularrhythm" answer="3" question="Right before 0:43 above, how many forms of non-regular rhythm are used?" options="1 | 2 | 3 | 4" explanation="There, there is a series of rhythmic changes that add intensity. Firstly, the accents are thrown off the beats. Sometimes they move to the offbeat. Others just a 16th note off from the beat. Importantly, there is no pattern for the changing accents. Secondly, there is a long string of triplets. Before, the beats were divided nicely into 16th notes. So when there is a string of triplets, you get thrown off. Finally, right before the release of tension, there is a pause. Within a string of ever-increasing rhythm, a rest throws everything off." %}

Each of these are ways in which there is non-regular rhythm.

Because the listener keeps getting thrown off, the tension increases.

## Can This Work For "Real" Melodies

Of course! Listen to the first several melodies from the *Indiana Jones* theme. Each and every melody creates it's climax through rhythm. Try to find these principles that we've talked about in these melodies.

But the question becomes, how can you learn to apply this to your own melody? Well, there's two ways. Firstly, you'll need to start identifying rhythm in actual melodies. Secondly, you'll need to start applying these rhythmic techniques into your own melodies.
