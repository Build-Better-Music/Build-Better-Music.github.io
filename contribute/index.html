	<h1>Contribute a Post</h1>
	<p>So you contribute a post, eh?</p>
	<p>Writing a post for Build Better Music has several advantages:</p>
	<ul class="checkmark">
		<li>Add to well of knowledge</li>
		<li>You can learn more by teaching (trust me, teaching helps)</li>
		<li>Exposure (you'll get links to all your social media as well as put a picture out for all to see)</li>
		<li>Credit (so you can forever show that you made a difference)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>To get started, I've setup this guide that explains everything you need to know.</p>
	<p>To keep the quality on this site, there are a couple guidelines about how to make a post. But all of them will be included here.</p>
	<p>Additionally, this page will explain how to format the post and how to send it to me so I can add it to the site. Lastly, you'll want to share it on social media so everyone will know about it.</p>

	<h2>1. Choosing a Topic</h2>
	<p>Topics can be anything you choose in reguards to composition. We mainly focus on instrumental composition. But if you have something engaging in another area, we'll be happy to include it.</p>
	<p>However, make sure it <b>targets composers</b>.</p>
	<p>That means we are not here to explain theory. We are not here to analyze music. We are here to develop skills of composition. Sure, that may mean theory and analysis, but the point of the post should be composition.</p>
	<p>For instance, you can explain a theoretical concept and then show how to apply it, but <i>don't stop with the theory</i>.</p>
	<p>Additionally, write in a style consistent to the work here. You don't have to be formal. "I", "we", "me", "you", contractions, and short sentences are allowed. And starting sentences with "and" and "but".</p>
