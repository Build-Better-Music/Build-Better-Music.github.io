8 measure melodies can get boring. Especially if you write them all the time.

This comes from their inate sense of predictability. Compelling composition constantly seeks to create expectations and then defy them. So if you are always writing 8 measure melodies, you are never defying expectations!

That's why you need to vary the [structure of your melody](/blog/BuildingBlocksOfMelody). And one way to do that is altering the lengths of your motives.

So in this post, I'm going to give you 3 simple ways to alter the lengths of your motives to keep your audience engaged and hooked throughout the entire piece.

<!--end-of-intro-->

## 1. Why Note Repeat Some Material? Repeat Fragments

Inside each motive, there are likely some interesting fragments. Ask yourself, "which fragments define the motive?" Then, why not repeat them?

Why not?

The effect you can create is that your melody is "spinning out". Let's see this in action.

{% include youtube.html url="uyypHlrZsgg" start="15" %}

This is one of the melodies near the very start of Wagner's *Die Meistersinger* Overture. As you can hear, the same fragments keep getting repeated over and over again. This is borderline excessive, yet the entire melody still has clear motives. Listen for the structural markers of the melody (it extends to a minute in). You'll hear that it still follows the traditional motive structure, just fragments are repeated.

You can do this to. It doesn't need to be anywhere close to this extent. But making a melody slightly longer will create all the variety necessary.

> Pro tip: If your melody already has repeated fragments, you can delete those fragments to create a shorter motive.

## 2. Changing the Framework of the Motive: Altering Time Signatures

In 4/4, each motive is normally 8 beats. Adding another measure would get you 12 beats, and taking away a measure would net 4 beats. But why not have a 6 beat melody? Or even a 6.5 beat melody? Again, why not?

You can achieve this by [changing your time signatures](/blog/IncreaseRhythmicVarietyInYourMelody#just-change-the-time-signature).

This is exactly what John Mackey does in the last movement of his symphony, *Wine-Dark Sea*:

{% include youtube.html url="GyvcDPuUzO4" start="1494" %}

Notice how in the 3rd motive, for two of the measures he switches to 2/4 instead of 4/4. This is enough to keep some variety to his motive lengths.

{% include quiz.html quizid="structure" answer="4" question="What is the structure of this melody?" options="<em>a b a b&prime;</em> | <em>a a&prime; a&Prime; b</em> | <em>a b a&prime; c</em> | <em>a a&prime; b c</em>" explanation="It's the <em> b </em> that is shortened by the two 2/4 measures. It can be a bit difficult at first to figure out the structure of this melody because the <em>b</em> motive sounds like two different motives, but that is just a <a href='/blog/FractalMelodies'>consequence of how he wrote it</a>." %}

## 3. Cut Out A Measure For Fun (or Add One)

The third and final way is to simply cut out a measure from a motive. This works especially well if the motive is a variation (e.g. *a&prime;* ).

Take a look at this melody from one of the pieces I wrote, *Bucolic Songs*:

The second motive is simply an *a&prime;*, so instead of repeating the motive in full, I cut out the second half. This keeps the melody moving forwards. Because the motivic structure is speeding up, it creates extra energy.

> In technical terms, taking out measures increases the hyperrhythm. Just like increasing normal rhythm, increasing the hyperrhythm increases intensity.

## When do I do This?

So now that you know about the different ways to alter motive lengths, when should you do this?

There are really two cases, and both of them can work incredibly well:

1. For the initial melody
2. For variations on the original melody

Either way, altering motive lengths will help keep you from getting in the 8-measure-melody-rut and add variety to your music. So it's a good skill to learn.
