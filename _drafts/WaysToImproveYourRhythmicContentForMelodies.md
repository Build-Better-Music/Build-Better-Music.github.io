Rhythm is one of the least looked at aspects in melody writing because there are so many things to learn.

However, mastering rhythm in the context of a melody can take your melodies to the next level.

I've already talked about specific techniques to improve your [rhythmic variety in melodies](/blog/IncreaseRhythmicVarietyInYourMelody), but today I'm going to show you how get used to applying those ideas in your melodies.

Here are 2 specific practice techniques that I use to get better rhythm in melodies.

## Way 1: Rhythm Only Melodies

To start, you are going to write rhythm only melodies. That means no notes, only rhythms.

First, let's see the overall process:

1. Pick a technique to improve on
2. Write a rhythm melody
3. Improve the melody with that technique
4. Write several new rhythm melodies and improve them using that technique
5. Repeat 2-4 with a new chosen technique

And there are several techniques, many of which we've covered in other posts. They are [rhythmic climaxes](/blog/RhythmicClimaxes), [motivic structure](/blog/BuildingBlocksOfMelody), [syncopation](/blog/IncreaseRhythmicVarietyInYourMelody#the-keys-to-syncopation), [rests](/blog/IncreaseRhythmicVarietyInYourMelody#add-rests), [non-standard tuplets](/blog/IncreaseRhythmicVarietyInYourMelody#dont-forget-the-tupletsand-not-just-triplets), [changing time signatures](/blog/IncreaseRhythmicVarietyInYourMelody#just-change-the-time-signature), as well as many others.

And by isolating them from pitch, you can ensure that you are making your rhythm interesting as well.

## Way 2:

Once you have learned many of the techniques for improving your rhythm, you can move onto this step.

It involves taking a pitch line and then adding rhythm to it. Here's the process below.

With the rhythms.

When doing this, make sure you use every note in the pitch line. Afterall, once you learn to write pitch lines, you know that they can be carefully constructed. Every single note matters.

And after writing the rhythm to a pitch line, make sure to improve on it using the techniques you've learned in the first way. And make sure it sounds coherent, which requires a strong knowledge and skill in motivic structure.

## Getting Started

That is the basic process for getting better rhythms in melodies. Each technique you learn to master becomes another tool in your toolbox. The more tools you have, the better your writing. And by using these two methods to improve your rhythm, you can add any rhythmic tool to your toolbox.

You now have everything you need to get started. But I can only do so much. It is up to you to actually apply these practice methods.
