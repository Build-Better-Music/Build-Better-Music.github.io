If you've been following up to this point, you have the following skills:

- [Write motives quickly from scratch](/blog/WritingMotives)
- [Name motives and find variations](/blog/MotiveNames)

Now it's time to put all these skills together and get the final piece to learn the secret to consistently building a great melody.

## The Magic Structure

### Quick Recap

![Melody Structure](/blog/resources/melodyStructure.png "Melody Structure"){:.center-image}

Melodies are broken down into two phrases, each of which are broken down into two motives.

Motives can be pretty much anything you want to write. Getting used to writing motives quickly can be a great way to get the creative juices flowing.

Finally, motives are given names based on their relation to other motives and the order in which they appear. The first motive is *a*, the second *b*, the third *c*, etc. If a motive is a variation on a previous motive, you add the prime symbol (e.g. a variation on *b* becomes *b&prime;*).

### How do you organize the motives?

You can organize them any way you would like, as long as you follow two simple rules:

- You must vary either *a* or *b* before you can add a *c*
- The exact same motive cannot be repeated 3 times in a row

For the first rule, that essentially rules out structures like *a b c a&prime;*, because there is a *c* before either *a&prime;* or *b&prime;*.

The second just means you cannot have *a b b b*, *a a a b*, or *a a&prime; a&prime; a&prime;*.

{% include quiz.html quizid="structure" answer="1" question="Which of the following is <em>not</em> an allowed structure?" options="<em>a b a c</em> | <em>a a&prime; b c</em> | <em>a b a&prime; c</em> | <em>a a b a</em>" explanation="The second motive breaks the rule that you need variation before you can add a <em>c</em>." %}

And what these two rules is it gives a balance of **repetition and variation**. Those are the two keys for making your melody sound cohesive and memorable.

**Repetition and variation is key**.

{% include quiz.html quizid="repetitionVariation" answer="1" question="Which rule enforces that you have enough repetition in your melody?" options="You must vary either <em>a</em> or <em>b</em> before you can add a <em>c</em> | The exact same motive cannot be repeated 3 times in a row" explanation="By making sure you need variation before you can add a new motive, you ensure that you are repeating things. It also makes sure that your first ideas get some sort of comment on them because variation and not straight repetition is required. The other rule of not repeating the same motive 3 times in a row enforces variation." %}

## Application

Now that you know how to organize your motives, how do you use this?

It's actually quite simple. Once you have your motives and several variations, just pick a structure (like *a a a&prime; b*) and then just input your motives  into the structure.

And voila! You have a melody! Sure, it might need some refinement to make sure the ideas flow more naturally. But this way you know you can create good melodies more consistently.

Of course, practicing this over time will help you get better at understanding the process. And to help you with that, just get the free accompanying worksheet below. If you are already a subscriber, the worksheet is in your inbox.
