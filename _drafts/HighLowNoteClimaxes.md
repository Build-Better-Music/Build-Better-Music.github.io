If you ever want to understand how to write a good melody, you have to learn how to write this type of [climax](/blog/4WaysToAddMeaningToYourMelody).

It is so common, so easy, and so effective that every good melodist has this simple skill in their tool kit.

However, while it is easy to write a melody that simply has a high or low point, there are some concepts that you want to think about. A melody won't feel climactical simply because it has a high point. There has to be thought to it.

Luckily, I'm going to share a few key insights that will make your high or low points much more climactic.

<!--end-of-intro-->

## The Build

Of all the mistakes I've heard (and done myself) with this type of climax, it's this one: the unprepared climax.

**You can't simply make a melody climactic by inserting a high note**. You need to build to the high note.

[INSERT STORY ARC]

In the [main post on climaxes](/blog/4WaysToAddMeaningToYourMelody), I showed this diagram of a story arc. Your melody must follow this story arc. If you are going for a high note climax, you *must* progressively get higher until you reach the climax. And between each local high point, you *must* give some resolution by going back downwards.

{% include quiz.html quizid="build" answer="4" question="Without constant building to the high note, what would happen?" options="Nothing, there will be no build to the climax | The high note would stick out | The high note will be ineffective | All of the above | None of the above" explanation="High notes are only as effective as what comes before it. If there is no sense of building to a high note, the high note won't sound particularly high. Some of the greatest operatic arias have the singer singing a really high note that sounds like the top of their range. Then, to climax the melody, they gliss to a half step higher." %}

Just like stories where there is constant tension and release (but overall the tension is *building*), your melodies must have constant tension and release with an overall build.

As you try to incorporate this into your writing, [think of each motive as a little mini melody](/blog/FractalMelodies). Where is the high point in your motive? Is each successive motive slightly higher?

> Pro tip: Don't simply make each motive higher. Add more range to the motive. If the first motive encompases a 5th, the next should encompass a 6th or larger.

## The Placement

How would you feel if you read a mystery novel and it was solved in the second chapter? Cheated? Unfulfilled? Unsatisfied?

Then how do you think listeners would feel if you give them your high point in the second motive? Likely the same way.

That's because climaxes achieve their effect through the release of built up tension. Therefore, try to make your climax towards the end of your third motive or start of your fourth motive.

## Make it Sound Not Forced

One of the keys to a great melody is to make sure that the climax does not feel forced. Here are a few suggestions for accomplishing this:

1. Keep your climax off the downbeat
2. Make your high note be on an off beat

Here's two examples of both of these princples.

[INSERT UNFORCED CLIMAX EXAMPLES]

What both of these will do is make sure that your climax isn't in the expected location.

> Of course, you can break from both of these suggestions. *Binary Sunset*, which I used in the [main post on climaxes](/blog/4WaysToAddMeaningToYourMelody), doesn't follow either of these suggestions.

## Don't Forget About the Low Point

Everything I talked about above can be applied to low points as well. They are often overlooked yet can still be quite effective. The best part of a low point climax is that it sounds unique and people won't realize how you created the climax. However, because it is less common, it will take a bit more practice to get a feel for how to do a low point climax.
