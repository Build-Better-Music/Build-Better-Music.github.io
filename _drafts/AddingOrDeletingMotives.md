Though 8-measure motives are the way you should really learn to start writing melodies, relying on that structure can make your music extremely repetitive.

And repetitive is boring.

You want interesting music. And to do that, you need to vary the lengths of your melodies. This can be done two ways; you can either alter the length of your motives, or you can alter the number of motives in your melody.

So in this post, we are going to look at some of the ways in which you can add interest by adding or deleting motives from your melodies.

## Adding Motives

This almost always done by repeating motives. Sometimes, even verbatim.

{% include youtube.html url="gf2roj0D3WM" start="31" %}

The basis for the *Imperial March* melody is simply that he repeats the last two motives with a slight variation at the end. This specific technique has occurred for literally centuries.

{% include quiz.html quizid="structure" answer="2" question="What is the structure of this melody?" options="<em>a a&prime; b c</em> | <em>a a&prime; b c b c&prime;</em> | <em>a a&prime; b b&prime;</em> | <em>a b b&prime;</em>" explanation="It's just like a normal 4 motive melody expect the last 2 motives are repeated. Each motive is still 2 measures. The last motive is slightly altered to give more closure at the end." %}

The alternative is deleting motives.

## Deleting Motives

This small snippet of a melody is the bridge from [*When Christmas Comes to Town*](https://youtu.be/sSZbpOItGUg?t=1m25s) from the *Polar Express*! Don't believe me, take a listen.

In fact, though it is so much shorter, it still includes two of the most recognizable elements from the original melody: the first motive and the last motive.

{% include quiz.html quizid="deleted" answer="2" question="How many motives were deleted from the original melody?" options="1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5" explanation="2 motives were deleted from the original. They were motives 2 and 3." %}

Deleting motives can be as simple as deleting them. If the context is appropriate, it will work.

*The key is making sure that the remaining motives are the motives that define the melody the most*.

In this specific case, the most memorable parts of the bridge are the beginning and the ending. Therefore, that's what Alan Silvestri chose to include in this highly shortened version.

## Now What?

If adding or deleting motives really interests you, I'd highly recommend studying film scores. Because composers need to match up their music precisely with the film, they have many little tricks like this to get the timing perfect.

Each of these tricks are ways you can add variety to your music.

I'd also start practicing these techniques with a melody you've written. Write a simple 8-measure melody and then create 5 variations. For each variation, try to either add or delete motives. Use a variety of methods for each one. This way, you'll start to get comfortable doing this.

If you would like more help, download the free worksheet below. It will walk you through the exact process of analyzing melodies to see which motives they added/deleted and then using that same method in your own melody. If you are already a subscriber, the worksheet is in your inbox.

Happy writing!
