The key to making interesting melodies is repetition and variation. We've talked a lot about repetition and ways to add variety to your melody. But 8 measures it not a ton of space.

Especially if you follow my guide to structuring melodies with motives. You'll only get 4 motives!

However, there is a tool that many of the pros use to make their melodies even more memorable.

And it's a simple tool that will allow you to pack even more repetition and variation within your 8 measures.

## What is a Fractal?

In math, a fractal is a shape that is self-similar on several different scales.

This means, if you zoom in, the resulting image looks a lot like the original shape.

Check out the Koch snowflake. See how each of the smaller segments looks like the original line segment? Fractal!

## Fractals and Music

Perhaps no living composer is better at creating earworms and utilizing fractal melodies than John Williams. Let's look at one of his most iconic melodies from *Indiana Jones*.

> Note: to understand the rest of this post, you'll need to completely understand my [motivic structures with melodies](/blog/BuildingBlocksOfMelody)

First, let's note the overall structure of this melody. It's a nice 8 measures with 2 measure motives: *a a&prime; a&Prime; b*.

At this point, you have probably noticed a lot of the repeated elements, such as the dotted 8th 16th motive.

But how are they structured?

{% include quiz.html quizid="fractals" answer="1" question="If we are going to look at fractal melodies, then how should we look at the melody?" options="In smaller chunks | In larger chunks with context" explanation="Since fractals look similar when zoomed in, if we look at smaller chunks of the melody, we should start to see elements of motivic structure start to appear!" %}

Let's just look at the first 4 measures now. Why don't we apply the concept of fractals here?

When you look at it, the first half of the melody is structured *a a&prime; a&Prime; b*. Notice any similarities?

That's right! The first half of a melody can be structured like an entire melody! Does this also apply to the second half?

![Second Half Analyzed](/blog/resources/indianaJonesSecondFractal.png "Second Half Analyzed"){:.center-image}

It does: *a a&prime; b b&prime;*. What this also tells us is that the structure of the smaller melodies doesn't have to be the same as the entire melody. Just for increased repetition you can organize the subsections as if they were a full melody!

How amazing is that!

## Let's Not Stop There

We are still analyzing full measures and haven't yet gotten into the individual fragments yet. What if we just look at the first two measures?

![First Two Measures Analyzed](/blog/resources/indianaJonesSecondaryFractal.png "First Two Measures Analyzed"){:.center-image}

We still get a recognizable form: *a b a&prime; b&prime;*. And the same can be applied to the entire melody. For the sake of brevity, here is the entire melody analyzed this way.

Isn't this cool? More importantly, do you see how this relates to fractals?

On every scale, the form of the motives/fragments form a recognizable and valid structure for our melodies. The only time he breaks this rule is at the very end on the smallest level (*a a a a&prime;*). Other than that, it looks just like a fractal.

## That's great. How Can I Use This?

When I write a melody that I want to be incredibly memorable, I start from the smaller components and then build things up. For instance, I'd start by writing one small fragment and then making a motive out of that fragment using the same techniques I'd use to [write a melody](/blog/WritingMotives). Then, I'll write another motive. And once you have two motives, you can write a melody!

But a quick word of caution: **the more repetition you have, the more variation is required**. Therefore, if you start with a really small fragment, you'll need to vary that fragment a lot.
