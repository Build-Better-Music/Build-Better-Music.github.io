One mistake I've often seen in many composers is that their melody is static. Even if they've [created a climax](/blog/4WaysToAddMeaningToYourMelody) using five different methods, it doesn't go anywhere.

The result is often because the melody seems to revolve around a certain note. Or at the least it keeps coming back to that note.

This means the melody isn't really traveling far. Any motion it gets is then halted by the return to a familiar note.

So how do we fix this?

## The Problem

First let's look at the problem in more detail.

[INSERT PROBLEM MELODY]

Here's a melody that seems quite static. One thing you'll notice is the recurrence of the note D. Because it keeps coming back to D, the melody can't move foreward.

Also, notice how several of the measures even sit around D. There are some neighbor tones in m2, and an appoggiatura to it in m4.

While these techniques of using non-chord tones are great to utilize, the problem is too much of the note D. Let's fix that.

## The Solution

Let's quickly strip the melody down to it's bare essentials. In each measure, we are going to leave only the most prominant note. We get something like below.

[INSERT STRIPPED MELODY]

Now you see what I was saying about so much D?

{% include quiz.html quizid="stripping" answer="4" question="When you strip a melody, what type of note do you <em>not</em> remove?" options="Non-chord tones | Short notes | Notes that are not an empahsis | The main note in a measure" explanation="Since we are trying to get to the underlying structure, you want to keep any notes that are the main focus. This includes the most prominant notes of each measure. Almost everything else you can discard." %}

But what happens when we move some of these notes around? We'll get something like below.

[INSERT STRIPPED ALTERED MELODY]

You can see a general arc to the melody now. What the new notes are doesn't matter as much as the fact that notes are changing. Though a nice arc to the melody is always a plus.

Now, I'm just going to add back in all the other notes that we had in the original melody. Except that this time everything will be in relation to our new main notes.

Much more interesting, right?

## Why the name?

The name comes from the fact that when the core notes of our melody move, magic happens. Hence, "Magic Moving Note"!

So practicing this is as simple as stripping a melody down to it's most fundamental notes and then moving them.
