After writing dozens or hundreds of melodies, you'll start to notice particular patterns. Especially when it comes to the pitches.

You'll notice that you will have tendencies. And that will likely start to frustrate you because you can't seem to figure out how to write anything new.

Luckily, I have some new tricks to help you increase your pitch variety in your melodies.

And I'm going to share 4 of them with you today.

<!--end-of-intro-->

## 1. Unlock New Notes with Modes

Especially if you are stuck in the major/minor world of writing music, you'll want to start experimenting with modes.

Major and minor are modes, but there are also 5 others that you can explore. Let's first see how to find them.

You know how the minor scale is simply the major scale starting on the 6th scale degree? So like B minor is simply a D Major scale starting on the 6th note?

What would happen if you start on other scale degrees? Like the 2nd or 5th? Those are the modes.

So here's all the modes you should try:

| Name | Scale Degree | Alterations |
| ---- | ------------ | ----------- |
| Ionian (Major) | 1 | 1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7 |
| Dorian | 2 | 1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 b3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6 b7 |
| Phrygian | 3 | 1 b2 b3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 b6 b7 |
| Lydian | 4 | 1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 #4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7 |
| Mixolydian | 5 | 1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6 b7 |
| Aeolian (Minor) | 6 | 1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 b3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 b6 b7 |
| Locrian | 7 | 1 b2 b3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4 b5 b6 b7 |

> My personal favorites are dorian and mixolydian. I would recommend starting with those.

{% include quiz.html quizid="modes" answer="3" question="If there is 3 sharps in the key signature, what note would the phrygian scale start on?" options="A | B | C# | D | E | F# | G" explanation="If there are 3 sharps, that means the major scale is A Major. Phrygian starts on 3&#770; of the major scale. C# is 3&#770;. Therefore, the phrygian scale starts on C#." %}

All you need to do to get started is take a melody you've written and adjust the required scale degrees. For instance, take a look at how you would make Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star into phrygian.

## 2. Explore New Scales

Of course, there are all sorts of other scales beyond the modes. The way to learn to use each of these is very similar.

1. Take a melody you've written and adapt the new scale, *or*
2. Explore the scale and write an original melody in the new scale

Here are just a few scales to explore:

- Double harmonic major
- Double harmonic minor
- Octatonic (diminished)
- Whole tone
- Harmonic/melodic minor
- Pentatonic
- Altered scale
- [Any of these other ones on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_musical_scales_and_modes)

## 3. Use Leading Tones to Increase Tension

While the first two ways involves learning new scales, this method focuses on adding new notes to a scale you are already using.

Leading tones are simply notes that resolve to another note by half step. They can be either higher or lower.

They work especially well with large leaps to either contextualize or emphasize the leaps. Here's how to do it.

Take a melody you already have with a large leap. You are going to write two variants of the leap. One with a leading tone below, and one with a leading tone from above. Like below.

It also works if you have a large downwards leap.

> Pro tip: Using leading tones works really well to create [unexpected note climaxes](/blog/UnexpectedNoteClimaxes), especially when combined with a [large interval climax](/blog/IntervalicClimaxes#the-secret-behind-large-intervals)

## 4. Begin on Dissonance

If you want to be different from 95% of all other composers, experiment with melodies starting on a dissonance.

{% include youtube.html url="2elNwFZ6HFM" start="167" %}

For instance, this melody from *Schindler's List* starts on an Eb, yet the first chord is a g minor chord. This is a rubbing half step dissonance. But because it resolves, it sounds okay.

{% include quiz.html quizid="dissonance" answer="2" question="What type of dissonance does this melody start out with?" options="Espace tone | Leading tone | Passing tone | Double neighbor tone" explanation="In fact, this is simply a leading tone like described above. But it is used as the very first note instead of in the middle of a leap! If you want to characterize this dissonance more completely, you could call it an incomplete neighbor tone." %}

## Other Methods

Of course, there are a multitude of other methods including other harmonic systems not touched here.

But these few tips are a very good starting point to adding pitch variety to your melodies.
