You've probably heard about certain intervals being more dissonant when those two notes are played.

But have you ever thought about using that dissonance to your advantage? Especially in the context of a melody?

Believe it or note, using dissonant or hard to sing intervals in a melody can actually make your melody more memorable and more singable!

Specifically, these intervals [create tension](/blog/4WaysToAddMeaningToYourMelody) that is waiting for some release.

And when you use this tension in your melodies, magic can happen!

So today I'm going to show you how to unlock this magic to make your melodies sparkle.

## The Secret Behind Large Intervals

To understand how large intervals can work in the context of a melody, let's look at the best singing intervals.

Here are some of the rules for a singable melody.

- Mostly stepwise motion
- Leaps of 4th or larger followed by a step in the opposite direction
- Permitted intervals: 2nd, 3rd, P4, P5, octave, ascending m6 (no 7ths)
- Two leaps in the same direction cannot outline a tritone or 7th
- If there are two leaps in the same direction, the second has to be smaller. Then you need to go stepwise in the opposite direction

These rules date back to the Renaissance. However, it's not then, so you can break these rules in instrumental writing.

In fact, to create intervallic tension, you need to break these rules.

And notice this, large intervals like the M6, 7th, 9th, 10th, etc. are not allowed with these rules. And if these rules are about creating singable melodies, then adding large intervals creates tension because it's hard to sing.

If you read the post on climaxes in melody, you will remember me using *Binary Sunset* as the example there. Here it is again. This time, though, as an exercise, try finding all the places in which John Williams breaks these rules. Then, try to find all the places he abides by them. Finally, ask yourself why is this melody so effective? And why does he break the rules when he does?

{% include quiz.html quizid="breaksrules" answer="6" question="How many times does John Williams break one of the above rules in this melody?" options="1 | 2 | 4 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 12" explanation="He breaks these rules 9 unique times. Why can he get away with breaking these rules? Each instance has a very specific reason." %}

## The Notes Matter Just Like The Intervals

However, adding larger intervals isn't the only way to create tension through intervals. There are other methods you can use which we'll uncover.

Firstly, the placement of the interval matter as well. For instance, the P5 is a consonant interval and is somewhat large. And using it between 1&#770; and 5&#770; releases lots of tension.

However, what happens if you go from 3&#770; to 7&#770; (7&#770; being the leading tone and having tension in and of itself)?

That's exactly what Brahms does in his *Cradle Song*, a melody which you've probably heard dozens of times.

There are two things going on. First is that he used the interval to a note full of tension (7&#770;). Second he used increasingly larger intervals until the climactic interval.

But when you don't simply want a larger interval, ask yourself if you can place the interval somewhere that would be more tense.

## Using Dissonant Intervals

Another way to create tension through intervals is to have dissonant intervals. What would these intervals look like? Here's some examples.

- A4/d5 (tritone)
- m7 and M7
- m9
- Any augmented or diminished interval

Usually, these intervals will require accidentals when in a diatonic scale (not between 4&#770; and 7&#770;).

Because dissonance is tension, you can use these dissonant intervals to create tension for a release. Simply place this interval at the climax and you can create a convincing climax.

## Combining Dissonant Intervals with Unexpected Notes For More Power

One powerful way to create a climax with a dissonant interval is to combine it with an [unexpected note climax](/blog/UnexpectedNoteClimaxes). It's a two for one. Two climaxes for a single note!

Furthermore, the example I wrote for the unexpected note climax melody actually is also an example of a dissonant interval climax. [Go check it out](/blog/UnexpectedNoteClimaxes) to see it how to combine both.
