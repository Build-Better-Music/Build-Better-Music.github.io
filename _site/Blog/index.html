<p>But have you ever thought about using that dissonance to your advantage? Especially in the context of a melody?</p>

<p>Believe it or note, using dissonant or hard to sing intervals in a melody can actually make your melody more memorable and more singable!</p>

<p>Specifically, these intervals <a href="/blog/4WaysToAddMeaningToYourMelody">create tension</a> that is waiting for some release.</p>

		<p>When creating a <a href="/blog/4WaysToAddMeaningToYourMelody">climax for a melody</a>, it can become very tempting to talk about pitch.</p>

<p>However, the rhythm is equally important. And if you plan it right, the rhythm can completely carry the climax. Because rhythm is so instinctual and subtle, often times its effectiveness comes from the fact that listeners won’t know that rhythm was the cause.</p>

<p>So for this post, we are going to dissect two of the key ways to create a convincing rhythmic climax.</p>

		<p class="postInfo">August 31, 2018 | Nick Mazuk</p>
		<p>One mistake I’ve often seen in many composers is that their melody is static. Even if they’ve <a href="/blog/4WaysToAddMeaningToYourMelody">created a climax</a> using five different methods, it doesn’t go anywhere.</p>

<p>The result is often because the melody seems to revolve around a certain note. Or at the least it keeps coming back to that note.</p>

<p>This means the melody isn’t really traveling far. Any motion it gets is then halted by the return to a familiar note.</p>

<p>So how do we fix this?</p>

		<p>Though 8-measure motives are the way you should really learn to start writing melodies, relying on that structure can make your music extremely repetitive.</p>

<p>And repetitive is boring.</p>

<p>You want interesting music. And to do that, you need to vary the lengths of your melodies. This can be done two ways; you can either alter the length of your motives, or you can alter the number of motives in your melody.</p>

<p>So in this post, we are going to look at some of the ways in which you can add interest by adding or deleting motives from your melodies.</p>

		<p>8 measure melodies can get boring. Especially if you write them all the time.</p>

<p>This comes from their innate sense of predictability. Compelling composition constantly seeks to create expectations and then defy them. So if you are always writing 8 measure melodies, you are never defying expectations!</p>

<p>That’s why you need to vary the <a href="/blog/BuildingBlocksOfMelody">structure of your melody</a>. And one way to do that is altering the lengths of your motives.</p>

		<p>Writing melodies may seem like an ambiguous and abstract skill to learn, but the techniques for  writing effective melodies are quite simple.</p>

<p>Like many things, melodies are made up of a bunch of smaller building blocks. And when you learn how to write these small building blocks, you can simply start to piece the entire melody together.</p>

<p>We’re going to start simple: eight measure melodies. Yes, eight measure melodies. Why? Because once you learn how to write an eight measure melody, you know how to vary the length and keep it coherent and interesting. We’re keeping it simple.</p>

<p>So, without further ado, here’s the general structure for an eight measure melody:</p>
