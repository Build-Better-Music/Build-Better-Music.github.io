	<h1>4 Ways to Add Meaning to Your Melody</h1>
	<p class="postInfo">August 31, 2018 | Nick Mazuk</p>
	<p>So you’ve written several melodies, but you can’t figure out how to make a melody that has any meaning?</p>

<p>You’ve probably done research on, and maybe have even read and practiced <a href="/blog/BuildingBlocksOfMelody">my structure for writing melodies</a>, but you still can’t figure it out!</p>

<p>There’s one little secret that will solve your problem almost instantly: climaxes. You have to make sure your melody is going somewhere for your melody to have any sort of meaning. Understanding climaxes is the key to making that happen.</p>

<p>So today, I’m going to show you 4 simple ways to create climaxes in your melody through what I believe to be one of the most perfectly constructed melodies of all time.</p>

<!--end-of-intro-->

<h2 id="what-is-a-climax-and-what-does-it-have-to-do-with-music">What is a Climax? And What Does it Have to do with Music?</h2>

<p><img src="/blog/resources/plotArc.png" alt="Plot Arc" title="Plot Arc" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>You may have heard about the general structure of a plot in your high school English class, but if not, here’s a quick recap.</p>

<p>Stories have to start out somewhere. There, we meet our characters until there is some sort of tension that arrises. Then, the story gradually gets more tense until it reaches a climax, when some sort of goal has been reached. Then, the story resolves.</p>

<p>What if we took this same structure and applied it to melodies?</p>

<p>It turns out that you can, and I’ve been doing it for years now. In fact, I’ve even gone as far as writing pieces based of a more detailed version of this arc. But for now we are going to focus on melodies.</p>

<p>Here are the 4 ways to create climaxes like this in a melody.</p>

  <li><a href="UnexpectedNoteClimaxes">Unexpected Note/Chord</a></li>
  <li><a href="IntervalicClimaxes">Intervalic Tension</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s take a quick look at how each of these are used in <em>Binary Sunset</em> from <em>Star Wars: A New Hope</em>.</p>

<h2 id="climaxes-in-melody">Climaxes in Melody</h2>

<p><img src="/blog/resources/binarySunset.png" alt="Binary Sunset" title="Binary Sunset" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>Perhaps the most obvious form of climax is that of the high point in this melody. In measure 6, we reach a high G. This obviously sounds like the climax when you listen to it, and that is exactly where John Williams places the high note.</p>

<p>Next, you’ll notice that the rhythm speeds up to that point. It is based on the rhythms from the earlier motives, but the dotted 8th 16th rhythm adds a sense of urgency. And at the final climax, there is a long note to show that we’ve finally arrived.</p>

<p>Then you’ll notice that the harmony is an E♭ major chord. This isn’t terribly surprising as it is the ♭6 chord of the key, but it is significant because it is the only major chord in the entire melody (and the most prominent one in the score for the several minutes surrounding the moment). The contrast to the surrounding chord is what give it the “unexpectedness”. That’s what causes the climax.</p>

<p>Finally, you’ll notice that as the melody goes on, the size of the intervals gradually increases. Larger intervals are generally more tense, so as the melody finally reaches an interval of an octave, it has a sense of propulsion. The full downwards octave causes a sense of release from all the intervallic tension that was built.</p>

<h2 id="parting-notes-literally">Parting Notes, Literally</h2>

<p>The effectiveness of this melody comes from the fact that all these main ways of creating climaxes (and others as well) all coincide at the same moment in time. Each technique is powerful in and of itself, but combined they are magical.</p>

	<div class="answer-explanation" style="display:none;"><p>Just like a good story, music gets meaning from creating tension and then releasing it. Some of the most memorable scenes in film, books, dramas, and even operas is where there is a lot of tension. Because you don't know how the tension is going to be resolved. The same goes for melodies.</p></div>
</div>

<p>And they are all the products of building tension. As we noted in the story metaphor, tension is built until it is released at the climax. This tension building comes from the exact same methods as the climax. So the notes progressively get higher, the intervals larger, and the rhythm faster, all until they climax at the—well—climax.</p>

<p>Then, like a story, there is a resolution to each and every one of them. So the final motive of the melody releases all the tension built up before. The intervals gradually get smaller in the last note, the harmony returns to normal, the melody slowly descends to the final note, and the rhythm gradually gets slower. It’s not enough to simply create a climax, we have to resolve it as well.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The melody actually achieves a low point right after the climax, as if it is overcompensating. The result is that the ending feels right in the middle where the least tension is. The two extremes right next to each other also makes for a balanced melody.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="how-do-i-apply-climaxes">How do I Apply Climaxes?</h2>

<p>The simple solution is to start writing your own. I’ve written articles that go more in-depth on each of these ways of creating climaxes (<a href="/blog/HighLowNoteClimaxes">High/Low Note</a>, <a href="/blog/RhythmicClimaxes">Increased Rhythmic Activity</a>, <a href="UnexpectedNoteClimaxes">Unexpected Note/Chord</a>, <a href="IntervalicClimaxes">Intervalic Tension</a>), so you can read them for more understanding.</p>

<p>But the best way is to really just start writing. Write a melody and then try to improve it by adding a climax of some sort. Pick a climax and then make the melody fit that climax. It’s okay if it’s not good at first, it just takes practice. Mistakes are the only way to learn.</p>

<p>Happy writing!</p>
