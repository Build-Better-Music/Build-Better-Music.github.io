	<h1>Increase Rhythmic Variety in Your Melody</h1>
	<p class="postInfo">August 23, 2018 | Nick Mazuk</p>
	<p>When you first start writing melodies, you’ll likely fall into a rhythmic rut. You just keep writing the same rhythmic fragments over and over again.</p>

<p>This can get boring.</p>

<p>But fear not! For I have several simple ways to add rhythmic variety to your melody!</p>

<p>Each of these are simple and easy to use. And with a little practice, you’ll notice that your melodies are far more engaging.</p>

<p>Let’s dive in.</p>

<!--end-of-intro-->

<h2 id="listen-listen-listen-then-listen-again">Listen, Listen, Listen… Then Listen Again</h2>

<p>I probably don’t ever stress this enough, but the key to understanding anything in music is to first listen. Why do you think almost every post includes an audio sample? Or two? Sometimes three or five or ten?</p>

<p>You will never be able to write music outside of the styles that you listen to. You can try, but you will never sound your best. So listen.</p>

<p>Once you listen, then analyze the music. Figure out what makes it interesting, and then try writing something that uses that.</p>

<p>Okay, enough of the aside. Let’s look at rhythmic techniques that you can employ now (which by the way, I use these because I listened).</p>

<h2 id="the-keys-to-syncopation">The Keys to Syncopation</h2>

<p>Syncopated music is music where the off beats and weak beats get the emphasis. Weak beats in 4/4 are beats 2 and 4. So if your melody emphasizes those beats and the off beats, you’ll have syncopated music.</p>

<p>And the feel is very distinct from traditional on-the-beat rhythms.</p>

<p>Learn to use syncopation. That will instantly get you out of the box of writing rhythms that fit nicely within the beats. The first step to writing good syncopated music is to listen to that style. Jazz is great for learning syncopation.</p>

<script src="/js/quiz.js"></script>

<div class="quiz" id="jazz" data-answer="4">
	<p class="question">Why is jazz good music to listen to for syncopation?</p>

	
	
	
		
		<div class="checkbox">
			<input type="checkbox" class="option" id="jazz1" /><label class="optionlabel" for="jazz1">There's lots of syncopation</label>
		</div>
	
		
		<div class="checkbox">
			<input type="checkbox" class="option" id="jazz2" /><label class="optionlabel" for="jazz2">Beats 2 and 4 are the strong beats</label>
		</div>
	
		
		<div class="checkbox">
			<input type="checkbox" class="option" id="jazz3" /><label class="optionlabel" for="jazz3">Modern jazz has many, many unique syncopations</label>
		</div>
	
		
		<div class="checkbox">
			<input type="checkbox" class="option" id="jazz4" /><label class="optionlabel" for="jazz4">All of the above</label>
		</div>
	
	<div class="answer-explanation" style="display:none;"><p>Jazz, especially after the swing era, is riddles with syncopation. Bebop is quite rhythmic because the notes move so fast, and if you listen to modern jazz like Maria Schneider you'll hear many advanced rhythms. Furthermore, traditionally beats 2 and 4 are the strong beats. This is in stark contrast to Western Classical music where beats 1 and 3 are strong.</p></div>
</div>

<p>But there are two keys that will help take your syncopation to the next level:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Syncopation is the anticipation of the next beat</li>
  <li>Syncopation requires notes on the beat</li>
</ul>

<p>The first key tells us that any syncopation will feel like the next beat came early. That’s how it creats energy. This means that you can easily make a melody syncopated by shifting some notes half a beat early.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/resources/nonSyncopatedMelody.png" alt="Freres Jacques Original" title="Freres Jacques Original" class="center-image" /></p>

<p><img src="/blog/resources/syncopatedMelody.png" alt="Freres Jacques Syncopated" title="Freres Jacques Syncopated" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>The second key explains that some notes need to be on the beat for the off beats to feel syncopated. Why is that?</p>

<p>What happens when all the notes become off beats? Every note starts to feel like an on beat. Therefore, on beats are key to make the off beats sound syncopated.</p>

<h2 id="dont-forget-the-tupletsand-not-just-triplets">Don’t Forget the Tuplets—And Not Just Triplets</h2>

<p>But even with syncopation, the internals of a beat still feel the same. You are still stuck on a framework of 8ths and 16ths.</p>

<p>That’s where tuplets come in!</p>

<p>Tuplets like triplets change the subdivision of a beat to give each beat a new feel. The rhythm cannot simply fit into a box. Tuplets change the box.</p>

<p>It’s the difference between 12/8 and 4/4. They have the same number of beats, the strong and week beats, but different internal subdivisions.</p>

<p>The key here is that simple triplets aren’t enough to add tons of variety nowadays. Switching between 8th notes and 8th note triplets is so commonplace that we hardly flinch when there is a switch between the two.</p>

<p>But there are other triplets to our disposal. Have you ever thought about using a 5-tuplet? What about a 7-tuplet? Try those and then see how your rhythm evolves. Write a melody with the goal of using a tuplet that is not a triplet.</p>

<h2 id="add-rests">Add Rests</h2>

<p>When thinking of melodies, we often think of long, lyrical lines. But we forget that melodies don’t need to be lyrical. They are just the most important figure that the listener hears.</p>

<p>So a melody can be littered with rests!</p>

<p>Here is a melody that is mainly rests:</p>

<p><img src="/blog/resources/melodyWithRests.png" alt="Barber of Seville" title="Barber of Seville" class="center-image" /></p>

<h2 id="just-change-the-time-signature">Just Change the Time Signature</h2>

<p>One of the main reasons why we get into a rut is because we keep using the same time signature. How often do you use 4/4? Don’t worry, we’re all guilty of it.</p>

<p>But your music can be so much more interesting if you simply try writing melodies in new time signatures. If you are stuck writing 4/4, write something in 3/4,</p>

<p>Or 2/4,</p>

<p>Or 5/4,</p>

<p>Or 7/8,</p>

<p>Or 15/16,</p>

<p>Or 8/8 (3+3+2),</p>

<p>Or 3.5/4,</p>

<p>Or even 2/3!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yes, all those time signatures do exist and have been used. Have you used them?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Getting out of your normal time signature will force you to come up with creative and novel solutions. How else can you ask for more rhythmic variety?</p>

<h2 id="other-ways">Other Ways</h2>

<p>Of course, there are other ways to increase your rhythmic variety, but these are just a couple ways that are easy yet effective.</p>

<p>So start practicing these today! Try writing a melody with utilizing each of these techniques. Also, try writing the same melody different ways: once as you normally would, once with syncopation, once with a tuplet, once with rests, and once with a new time signature. You’ll be amazed by how quickly your rhythmic pallet expands.</p>
