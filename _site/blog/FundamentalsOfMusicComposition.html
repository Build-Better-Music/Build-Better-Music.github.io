	<h1>6 Fundamentals of Music Composition</h1>
	<p class="postInfo">August 14, 2018 | Nick Mazuk</p>
	<p>Like all skills, composition has its fundamentals that must be mastered. And there are probably a lot more than you think.</p>

<p>Luckily, knowing what the fundamentals are can help dissect what you need to do to improve. No longer do think, “I need to get better”, but you rather, “I need to work on counterpoint”.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m actually working on counterpoint right now</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So with that said, let’s dive in and explore the different fundamentals of music.</p>

<!--end-of-intro-->

<h2 id="melody">Melody</h2>

<p>Melody is the line that the listeners pay attention to the most.</p>

<p>As you listen to the first couple minutes of Beethoven’s 7th, movement 2 (above), notice what you are listening to. That’s the melody.</p>

<p>It’s the part of a piece or song that you sing. It’s how you verbally share songs. It’s also probably one of the least studied areas of composition. Mastering melody is can set you leagues ahead of other composers.</p>

<p>See <a href="/blog/BuildingBlocksOfMelody">my guide to writing melodies here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="counterpoint">Counterpoint</h2>

<p>Counterpoint is what forms when two or more melodic ideas happen at the same time. Moreover, these lines are meant to work together.</p>

<p>Listen at a minute into the piece. Notice how the viola takes off in to a different idea than the rest of the strings? That is counterpoint.</p>

<p>It is a separate line, but it still works.</p>

<p>Counterpoint is normally taught as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterpoint#Species_counterpoint">species counterpoint</a>, where different note lengths determine the species. Note-against-note (both lines have the same rhythm) is first species counterpoint. Two notes for every one note is second species counterpoint. From here, the rhythm just gets more complex and there are “rules” that you need to follow for each species.</p>

<p>This method of composition dates back to the 1500s if not earlier, but is still used constantly today. If you haven’t rigorously studied species counterpoint and have done hours of practice with it, I’d recommend it. A good book to start with is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Study-Counterpoint-Johann-Joseph-Parnassum/dp/0393002772/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1534193623&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=fux+counterpoint">A Study in Counterpoint</a> by Johann Fux.</p>

<p>Counterpoint, however, is not only limited to old ideas. Even modern composers use counterpoint extensively and many have developed their own “rules” of counterpoint. Species counterpoint is based on 3rds and 6ths, but Hindemith wrote counterpoint often based on 4ths and 5ths. This gives him a unique sound while still keeping the core idea of counterpoint: multiple independent lines sounding at the same time.</p>

<h2 id="harmony">Harmony</h2>

<p>In modern Western music tradition, harmony is a result of counterpoint. Because when you write multiple lines at the same time, harmonies will form automatically. And especially in species counterpoint, this will lead to many chord progressions that we are familiar with today.</p>

<p>Listen to the first minute of Beethoven’s movement. It is based on the harmony. Since the melody isn’t terribly interesting, it’s the harmony that gives it interest.</p>

<p>Harmony is, though, one of the most studied fundamentals of music composition. Here are just a few of the harmonic systems that exist:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Common Practice Period Harmony</li>
  <li>The Basic Phrase</li>
  <li>Extended Chords</li>
  <li>Quartal/Quintel Harmony</li>
  <li>Pitch Class Sets</li>
  <li>12-Tone/Serialism</li>
  <li>“Jazz” Harmony</li>
  <li>Modal Harmony</li>
</ul>

<p>Furthermore, if you really want to explore how melody, counterpoint, and harmony all interrelate, you may wish to look into Schenkerian Analysis.</p>

<h2 id="rhythm">Rhythm</h2>

<p>The study of rhythm is relatively new compared to most other aspects of composition. Rhythm can help drive the piece forward by providing extra motivation.</p>

<p>And this doesn’t just have to be through the use of percussion. Faster rhythms in any voice general increases intensity. Notice how in the first couple minutes of the Beethoven movement that the rhythm slowly but steadily becomes more active. Notice how the energy of the piece grows as the rhythm grows.</p>

<p>That is the power of rhythm.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I will admit that I don’t know of a good way to explain rhythm, so if any of you have ideas, you comment with them below!</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="form">Form</h2>

<p>Form is how the overall piece is put together. Moreover, the study of form can go all the way from the <a href="/blog/BuildingBlocksOfMelody">melody level</a> all the way to the level of the entire piece.</p>

<p>Here’s a very rough form for the a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_variation">double variations form</a>. That means that the first section is a theme and variations on Theme A. The second section is a theme and variations on Theme B. The variations will often alternate between the two themes.</p>

<p>In this specific case, after the second section, he ends with a theme and variation on Theme A.</p>

<p>Learn form when you start to get comfortable with the other fundamentals. They are about writing notes. Form is about building the sections of music together.</p>

<h2 id="orchestration">Orchestration</h2>

<p>Orchestration is one of the most ignored fundamentals by most composers. The better you can orchestrate, the more your pieces will be played. Period.</p>

<p>You can have the best melodies, most innovative harmonies, and most acute understanding of form, but unless you master orchestration you will have a tough time getting your pieces played.</p>

<p>And when you do get them played, they won’t sound as you expect.</p>

<p>Then what is orchestration? Orchestration in the most basic form is figuring out what instrument is going to play what part. In a broader sense, it is about achieving balance, innovative textures, timbral interest, and insuring playability. To really understand orchestration, you have to become intimately familiar with every instrument as well as how each instrument interacts with every other instrument.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-you-need-to-work-on">What do you need to work on?</h2>

<p>Deciding what to work on and then concentrating on that is probably the fastest way to improve.</p>
