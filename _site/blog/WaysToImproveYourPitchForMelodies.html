	<h1>Ways To Improve Your Pitch Content For Melodies</h1>
	<p class="postInfo">August 31, 2018 | Nick Mazuk</p>
	<p>There are so many different aspects of melody that it can be difficult to work on all of them at once.</p>

<p>That’s why it is useful to break down melody writing into it’s basic components and then practice each of them individually. Then, when you combine everything together, you can start to sculpt a melody with all these tools in your toolbox.</p>

<p>So today, I’m going to give you two basic yet effective ways to isolate pitch in your melody writing. This will let you develop melodies that have <a href="/blog/IncreasePitchVarietyInYourMelody">solid pitch content</a> without needing to worry about structure, rhythm, dynamics, or anything else.</p>

<!--end-of-intro-->

<h2 id="way-1-write-a-pitch-line">Way 1: Write a Pitch Line</h2>

<p>The first way you should always practice when improving pitch is writing pitch lines. Don’t worry about rhythm. Only write notes.</p>

<p>Here’s an example of a pitch line.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/resources/pitchLineOriginal.png" alt="Pitch Line" title="Pitch Line" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>As you do this, tweak, add, or delete notes to make the pitch content stronger. Use different techniques that we’ve talked about, including the <a href="/blog/MagicMovingNote">magic moving note</a>, <a href="/blog/IncreasePitchVarietyInYourMelody#2-explore-new-scales">new scales</a>, <a href="/blog/UnexpectedNoteClimaxes">unexpected notes</a>, <a href="/blog/IncreasePitchVarietyInYourMelody#1-unlock-new-notes-with-modes">using new modes</a>, <a href="/blog/IncreasePitchVarietyInYourMelody#4-begin-on-dissonance">beginning on dissonances</a>, internal resolutions, delayed resolutions, and <a href="/blog/IncreasePitchVarietyInYourMelody#3-use-leading-tones-to-increase-tension">leading tones</a>.</p>

<p>As you do this, start by focusing on one technique of improving your pitch. Let’s say magic moving note. Then, modify your pitch line only to have better internal resolutions. For instance, you might change the pitch line from above into this.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/resources/pitchLineImproved.png" alt="Pitch Line Improved" title="Pitch Line Improved" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>Repeat this several times with several pitch lines. Then, focus on a new technique, like using leading tones. Write several new pitch lines focusing on improving your use of leading tones. Then focus on new technique. Repeat.</p>

<p>So overall, the process is:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Choose a technique of pitch to improve</li>
  <li>Write a pitch line</li>
  <li>Improve the pitch line with that one technique only</li>
  <li>Write several more pitch lines, improving each one using the technique</li>
  <li>Repeat 2-4 with a new technique</li>
</ol>

<p>Then, when you are writing complete melodies, you already have the skills to figure out what is bad and to improve it.</p>

<h2 id="way-2-write-to-a-rhythm">Way 2: Write to a Rhythm</h2>

<p>Writing a pitch line is great and works wonders. But it can be difficult at first to use those skills in a melody. Because you might feel like you need to add or delete notes, only to leave your melody sounding incoherent.</p>

<p>That is why it’s useful to also practice pitch with a rhythm. Here’s the process.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Write a <a href="/blog/WaysToImproveYourRhythmicContentForMelodies#way-1-rhythm-only-melodies">rhythmic melody</a> with a good structure</li>
  <li>Write pitches to each note without changing the rhythm at all</li>
  <li>Improve the pitches with the skills you learned writing pitch lines</li>
</ol>

<p>This is each step of a sample that I wrote, trying to begin on a dissonance for the improved melody.</p>

<p>Pitch Added:</p>

<p>Starting on Dissonance:</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

<p>That is the basic process for improving your pitch content in melodies. And like all compositional elements, melody is a skill. That means you actually need to practice and get started practicing. I can give you the tools and methods to practice, but it is your job to take action.</p>

<p>Luckily, I’ve made the process of getting started easier for you. If you would like help getting clear instruction to practice pitch in melodies, download the free worksheet below. It will walk you step by step through the process I’ve laid out above. If you are already a subscriber, the worksheet is in your inbox.</p>

<p>Happy writing!</p>
